# ðŸ“Š SQL for Job Analysis

This repository contains my self-learning project on SQL, guided by Luke Barousse. The project focuses on mastering SQL concepts and applying them to real-world job market analysis. It is divided into three main parts:

---

## ðŸ“˜ 1. Basics

The foundational section covers the core SQL concepts necessary for working with databases. Topics include:

- **What is SQL?**: Introduction to SQL and its purpose.
- **Comparison**: Using comparison operators in SQL queries.
- **Wildcards**: Utilizing wildcards for flexible matching.
- **Alias (`AS`)**: Simplifying table and column names.
- **Operations**: Performing mathematical and logical operations.
- **Aggregation**: Using aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.
- **Handling NULL Values**: Understanding and managing `NULL` values.
- **JOINS**: Combining data across multiple tables.
- **Order of Execution**: Learning the sequence of SQL query execution.

## ðŸ“— 2. Advanced

The advanced section dives deeper into SQL features and tools for managing and querying complex datasets. Topics include:

- **Setting up PostgreSQL**: Installing and configuring PostgreSQL for practice.
- **Data Types**: Understanding various data types in SQL.
- **Manipulating Tables**: Creating, modifying, and deleting tables.
- **Database Loading**: Loading datasets into a database.
- **Date Functions**: Working with dates and times in SQL queries.
- **CASE Expressions**: Writing conditional logic in SQL.
- **Subqueries and CTEs**: Nesting queries and using Common Table Expressions for better readability.
- **UNION Operators**: Combining results from multiple queries.

## ðŸ“‚ 3. Project

The final section focuses on applying SQL skills to analyze the job market. Key objectives include:

1. **Top Paying Jobs**: Identifying the highest-paying jobs.
2. **Top Paying Jobs' Skills**: Discovering the skills associated with high-paying jobs.
3. **In-demand Skills**: Identifying skills that are most sought after.
4. **Top Paying Skills**: Analyzing which skills lead to better pay.
5. **Optimal Skills**: Combining in-demand and top-paying skills for career optimization.
